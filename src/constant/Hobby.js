      "Everyone has a story. But not everyone has the space to tell it. At its heart, StoryClub is a space — not just for performance, but for expression. It's where stories heal, connect, provoke, and inspire. Whether it’s a childhood memory, a personal triumph, a quiet struggle, or an idea that shaped you — every voice matters here.",

      "I've always been someone who derives my grit and inspiration from music, especially Metal music and Rock music from the 70’s, 80s and 90s. With my ventures right now, I am trying to pass on the same to everyone between the ages of 5 to 55 through stories and illustrations.",

      "There’s something deeply calming about watching life unfold underwater — the slow dance of fins, the silent gliding of a turtle, or the curious gaze of a betta. My aquarium collection is more than a hobby; it’s a living expression of balance, patience, and wonder.",

    description:
      "Fitness, for me, isn’t about chasing perfection. It’s about movement, consistency, and self-respect. Wellness goes deeper — it’s how I eat, rest, think, and heal. It’s meditation when the noise gets too loud. It’s saying no when I need space. It’s nourishing the self so I can pour into others.",
